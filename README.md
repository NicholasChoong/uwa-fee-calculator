# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# 1st thing to do after cloning to your computer

## NPM (node package manager) method

Run `npm -v` to ensure npm (node package manager) is installed.

Run `npm install` to install all packages.

## Yarn method (alternative to using NPM)

Run `yarn -v` to ensure yarn is installed (alternative to npm).

Run `yarn` to install all packages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` OR `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**There are some other scripts but, to be honest, they don't matter at this point.** (this will be covered in the package manager workshop)
