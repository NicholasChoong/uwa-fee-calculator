                            The Australian Government subsidises a Commonwealth supported place by paying 
                            part of the fees for the place directly to the university and the student pays 
                            the remainder of the fees through a 'student contribution' amount.

                            postgraduate courses.

                            education and you will need to pay the tuition fees set by UWA. Some fee paying 
                            students are eligible for a FEE-HELP loan to pay their tuition fees.

                    <li>
                        Equivalent full-time student load (EFTSL) is a measure of the study load for a 
                        year of a student undertaking a course on a full-time basis.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The EFTSL value assigned to each unit of study taken in a course represents the 
                        workload in the unit as a proportion of the standard annual workload normally 
                        undertaken by a full-time student in that course. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        These calculations are normally based on the credit point values for coursework 
                        degrees. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Therefore, a 6 point unit taken in a course for which 48 points constitutes a 
                        standard annual workload would be assigned 6/48 = 0.125 EFTSL. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The same unit taken in a degree with 50 points in a standard year would be 
                        assigned 6/50 = 0.12 EFTSL.

                    <li>When calculating the student contribution amount for a unit, the formula is the

                        UWA has set the student contribution amount for a place at $3,950 
                        (the maximum permitted) for that unit of study in 2021. 
                        The EFTSL value for MATH1001 is 0.125 EFTSL (6/48). 
                        Therefore, Sandra’s student contribution amount for MATH1001 will be 
                        3,950 X 0.125 = $493.75
